This course introduces a systematic approach to managing acute, potentially life-threatening conditions even before a diagnosis is known, this clinical training aimed at frontline providers (doctors, nurses, clinical officers) who by necessity provide emergency care at their facilities, but have received little or no formal training in the field. The BEC course is traditionally taught over four and a half days, with a final written assessment given on the remaining half day. The course covers five major modules: The ABCDE approach, Trauma, Difficulty in Breathing, Shock, and Altered Mental Status. Each core component re-emphasizes the ABCDE approach as it relates to the management of varied emergency conditions. Participants are assessed using pre- and post-course multiple choice exams, skills performance, attendance, and the ability to manage patient case scenarios. The pre-course exam provides a means of baseline assessment, and is reviewed with the students for educational purposes. ",
